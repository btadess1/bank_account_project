# bank_account_project
This is a simple bank account project under development. In the current condition, it demonstrates
data encapsulation and hidding. It is a good example of data abstraction, since the user does not
have access to the peivate members of the BankAccount class, even though they can perform operations
like deposit, withdrawal, and balance checking.

//once the project is complete, it will have concurrency, synchronization, GUI, and other functionalities.
